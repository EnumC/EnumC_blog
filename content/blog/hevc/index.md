If you're on this page, you most likely encountered the dreaded "The HEVC Video Extension is required to display this file" error. ![rip](https://i.imgur.com/BqdbXLO.png)To make matters worse, Microsoft is charging a fee for you to display the image. the "HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer" link shows "Redeem a code" and "HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer is currently not available". 

After some quick research, here's how I was able to install the extension.

------

1. Go to [ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9n4wgh0z6vhq](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9n4wgh0z6vhq)
