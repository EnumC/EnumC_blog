Welcome! Do you have a random U.are.U 4500 fingerprint reader laying around collecting dust due to the lack of driver support on Windows 10?

After running into the same problem, I somehow found an updated WBF driver for it! That means it will work with Windows 10's Windows Hello feature.

Here's my reupload of the driver: http://ericqian.me/files/binary/uareu4500_driver_WBF_5005.zip

If that doesn't work, download it directly from my GitHub repo: https://github.com/EnumC/EnumC.com/blob/test-branch/files/binary/uareu4500_driver_WBF_5005.zip
