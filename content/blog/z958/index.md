I got an AT&T branded ZMAX 2 for free. It turns out, the device's latest firmware version appears to be Android 6.0.1. However, the device either needs an active AT&T card to download the OTA, or the OTA server might be down. In either case, I found some resources that still contains a downloadable copy of the firmware. If you still have this device, you might be able to turn it into a IoT webcam, smart home controller, and more. Reuse, Recycle, and don't throw electronics in landfill :)
